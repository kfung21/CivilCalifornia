## Fulfillment in Life
* Serve

## There are times to teach and not teach
* When relationships are strained and emotional, teaching may be perceived as judgment and rejection

* Teach when alone, quiet, and the relationship is good 

* Intimidation (fear) builds weakness. Depends on external factors to get things done. When fear replaces cooperation, both people become illogical and defensive.

## Things we blame
* Genetics
* Psychic - upbringing
* Environment - people and situtions that surround you

## Management vs Leadership
* Producers and Problem Solvers (Employees) - cutting through jungle with machettes
* Managers - behind employees, writing policy/procedure, sharpening the knives, set up schedules, compensation programs for employees
* Leader - climbs the tallest tree, surveys the situation, yells "Wrong Jungle!". 
    - The busy, efficient, employees and managers respond "shut up, we're making progress!"

## Habit 1: Proactive
### Application Actions
1. Listen to your language and others around you for __reactive language__
    - "If only"
    - "I can't"
    - "I have to"
2. Find an Example and how you would respond __proactively__
    - behave reactively in the past
    - remind yourself of gap between stimulus and response
    - make a commitment to yourself that you have the freedom to choose your response
3. Pick a problem at work/personal life
    - determine whether the problem ("control") is:
        * Direct - your behavior
        * Indirect - other people's behavior
        * No control - we can do nothing about
    - ID the first step in control of influence then take that step
4. 30 Day Test
    - be __proactive__ for 30 days
        * how we handle situations
            - how we view the problem
            - where we focus our energy
            - language we use/put out there
        * make small commitments and keep them
        * be a light not a judge
        * be a model not a critic
        * be part of the solution not the problem
        * don't argue for other people's weaknesses or your own
        * when you make a mistake: admit it, correct it, learn from it immediately
            - don't blame or accuse
        * work on yourself, things you can control
        * look at weaknesses of others with compassion, not accusation
            - issue isn't what they are doing/not doing
            - issue is your response to the situation and what you should be doing
            - if you think the problem is "out there", that thought is the problem
        * we are __Responsible__ for our own effectiveness, happiness, our own circumstances
            - don't act out the scripts written by parents, associates, and society
    - note the change in your circle of influence

## Habit 2: End in Mind
* Imagine being on deathbed, how do you want to be remembered? Work backwards
* Develop a mission statement
    - personal mission statement based on values
    - organizational mission statements must involve everyone to develop
### Mental (1st) Creation

    - See Potential
    - Conscience - ID our own personal endowments

### Being Effective
Effectiveness focus is a paradigm that grows out of a principle center

- be principle centered/personal mission/bigger picture (character ethics). Need self-discipline and motivation to avoid distractions and time wasters
