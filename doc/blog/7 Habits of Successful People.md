## Character Ethic (Enduring Principles)
* Fairness
    - The foundation of Justice
* Honest and Integrity
    - What Trust is built upon

    - Making a contribution/giving back
* Quality
    - Striving for Excellence and Improvement

## Personality Ethic

* Attitudes and Behaviors
  - Positive and Mental Attitude (PMA)
* Skills and Techniques

## 4 Life Support Factors
1. Security
    - sense of worth, your identity, your emotional anchorage, your self-esteem, your basic personal strength or lack of it
2. Guidance
    - your source of direction in life
3. Wisdom
    - your perspective on life, your sense of balance, your understanding of how the various
parts and principles apply and relate to each other
4. Power
    - faculty or capacity to act, the strength and potency to accomplish something

## Fulfillment in Life
* Serve
* Produce
* Contribute in meaningful ways
* learning/growing

## There are times to teach and not teach
* When relationships are strained and emotional, teaching may be perceived as judgment and rejection

* Teach when alone, quiet, and the relationship is good 

* Intimidation (fear) builds weakness. Depends on external factors to get things done. When fear replaces cooperation, both people become illogical and defensive.

## Things we blame
* Genetics
* Psychic - upbringing
* Environment - people and situations that surround you

## Management vs Leadership
* Producers and Problem Solvers (Employees) - cutting through jungle with manchettes
* Managers - behind employees, writing policy/procedure, sharpening the knives, set up schedules, compensation programs for employees
* Leader - climbs the tallest tree, surveys the situation, yells "Wrong Jungle!". 
    - The busy, efficient, employees and managers respond "shut up, we're making progress!"

## Habit 1: Proactive
### Application Actions
1. Listen to your language and others around you for __reactive language__
    - "If only"
    - "I can't"
    - "I have to"
2. Find an Example and how you would respond __proactively__
    - behave reactively in the past
    - remind yourself of gap between stimulus and response
    - make a commitment to yourself that you have the freedom to choose your response
3. Pick a problem at work/personal life
    - determine whether the problem ("control") is:
        * Direct - your behavior
        * Indirect - other people's behavior
        * No control - we can do nothing about
    - ID the first step in control of influence then take that step
4. 30 Day Test
    - be __proactive__ for 30 days
        * how we handle situations
            - how we view the problem
            - where we focus our energy
            - language we use/put out there
        * make small commitments and keep them
        * be a light not a judge
        * be a model not a critic
        * be part of the solution not the problem
        * don't argue for other people's weaknesses or your own
        * when you make a mistake: admit it, correct it, learn from it immediately
            - don't blame or accuse
        * work on yourself, things you can control
        * look at weaknesses of others with compassion, not accusation
            - issue isn't what they are doing/not doing
            - issue is your response to the situation and what you should be doing
            - if you think the problem is "out there", that thought is the problem
        * we are __Responsible__ for our own effectiveness, happiness, our own circumstances
            - don't act out the scripts written by parents, associates, and society
    - note the change in your circle of influence

## Habit 2: End in Mind
* Imagine being on deathbed, how do you want to be remembered? Work backwards
* Develop a mission statement
    - personal mission statement based on values
    - organizational mission statements must involve everyone to develop
### Mental (1st) Creation
* Imagination:
    - Envision - create in our minds what can't see presently
    - See Potential
    - Conscience - ID our own personal endowments
### 4 Human Endowments
1. **Self-Awareness**
2. Imagination
3. Conscience
4. Independent Will - Act not acted upon

## Habit 3: First thing First
### Physical (2nd) Creation
* Fulfillment, actualization, natural emergence of Habits 1 & 2
* Practicing Self Management: Day-in, day-out; moment-by-moment doing it
    - Manage from Left Brain (Logic)
    - Lead from Right Brain (Art)

### Self Management
|                    | Urgent      | Not Urgent      |
| ------------------ |:-----------:| :--------------:|

### Being Effective
Effectiveness focus is a paradigm that grows out of a principle center
- if centered on spouse, money, friends, pleasure, extrinsic or self then will thrown into Necessities and Distractions. Will react to outside forces or impulses
- be principle centered/personal mission/bigger picture (character ethics). Need self-discipline and motivation to avoid distractions and time wasters

#### Weekly Planning
1. ID your roles for the week (ie: worker, personal/individual, parent, spouse)
2. Select goals for the week
3. Scheduling - make time during the week to work towards achieving goals for the week
4. Daily Adapting - Things happen and need to review schedule every day to still achieve goals

### Delegation
1. Gofer (Micromanage)
    * "Go/do for this, go/do for that. Tell me when it's done"
    * Too focused on methods and feel responsible for results
        - the person receiving the task may not feel responsible
    * Most employees/producers still think like that once promoted
2. **Stewardship Delegation**
    * Focused on results instead of methods
    * Clear, up-front, mutual understanding, and commitment in expectations in 5 areas
        1. Desired Results
        2. Guidelines
            - few as possible, but include any restrictions
                * if don't give enough info and they violate rule unbeknownst, kills initiative and instills "just tell me what to do, and I'll do it" 
            - be honest and open
                * if you know failure paths, let them know upfront
                    - tell them what not to do, not how they should do it
                    - ok to give recommendation on how I'd do it
        3. Resources
            - ID human, financial, technical, or organizational resources they may want to use
        4. Accountability
            - set up performance standards for evaluating results (what's it for? why do this?) and due dates
        5. Consequences
            - Good and bad as a result of the evaluation
                * rewards, new job assignments, natural consequences
    * Gives people a choice of methods and responsible for results
    * Takes more initial time investment, but can increase your time leverage via effective Stewardship Delegation
    * Stewardship = job with trust
        - I trust you to do the job, to get it done. You're the boss of yourself now.
        - boss becomes the helper. may only have limited time, but employee tells boss how they can help
        - employee becomes the judge: 
            * regular check-ins with the boss. Employee tells boss how it's coming along
    * Trust is highest form of human motivation
        - takes time + patience + training/development (increase competency)
        - objective: empower the employee
    * More work gets done in less time in the future
    * Must want to manage, not just produce 
    * Focus on effectiveness not efficiency
    * With immature employees - fewer results, more guidelines/resources/check-ins/immediate consequences
    * With mature employees - more challenging results, less guidelines/check-ins
    * Effective delegation is best indicator of effective management: basis of personal/organizational growth

## Paradigms of Interdependence
* Must master self independence/discipline first
    - **you can't talk your way out of problems you behave yourself into**
    - most important part we put into any relationship is not our actions/words, but what we are
        * if words/actions come from superficial HR techniques (personality ethic) others will sense deception
        * can't be trusted
* golden eggs = effectiveness: the results from open communication, positive interaction w/others
* goose = relationships: must create and maintain

### Emotional Bank Account
* the amount of trust that's been built in a relationship
    - feeling of safeness with someone
* Make deposit into EBA through kindness, courtesy, honesty, and keeping commitments to someone
    - trust towards them increases
    - can use that trust if make mistakes in future, reserves compensate
    - must keep making deposits to maintain relationship
* when trust in EBA is high, communication is easy, instant, and effective
* Reduce trust in EBA:
    - showing discourtesy, disrespect
    - cutting them off
    - overreacting
    - ignoring
    - becoming arbitrary
    - betraying trust
    - threatening
    - playing god in your life
* Once trust in EBA low, have to be careful with every word/interaction/PYA
    - you may get tuned out
* When relationship deteriorates:
    - accommodation, 2 ppl live independent lifestyles and tolerate the other
    - hostility, defensiveness, verbal fights, emotional withdrawal, self-pity, cold war, legal battles
* Most constant relationships (ie: marriage) require most constant deposits
    - with continuous expectations, old deposits are lost
    - sometimes automatic EBA withdraws in daily interactions (ie: nagging)

### 6 Major Deposits
1. Understanding the Individual
    * What might be a deposit for you might not be for someone else. May be a withdrawal
    * To make a deposit: What is important to them must be as important to you as the other person is to you
        - what you may find unimportant may be very important to another person (ie: child)
        - stop projecting our autobiographies: interpret what a deposit is based on our needs/desires now or at a similar age/stage in life
        - understand others a you would like to be understood and do that
2. Attending to the Little Things
    * small discourtesies/unkindness/disrespect = large withdrawals
    * little things are the big things in relationships people remember most
3. Keeping Commitments
    * keeping a promise = major deposit
    * breaking one = MAJOR (biggest) withdrawal
    * don't make a promise you can't keep
        - make them very carefully/sparingly
        - be aware of variables/contingencies that may stop from fulfilling
        - be true to your word
4. Clarifying Expectations
    * unclear expectations in goals undermine communication and trust
        - leads to misunderstandings and large withdrawals
    * many times implicit (ie: marriage) and are based on assumed roles
    * get all expectations in a new situation. will be judged on those later
        - clarifying expectations takes a lot of courage and problems should be brought to the table and worked out
5. Show Personal Integrity
    * generates trust and is the basis of deposits
    * lack of integrity undermine all other efforts to create trust
    * be honest, keep promises, and fulfill expectations
        - be loyal to those not present. 
            * if you agree with gossip/criticism, suggest approaching non-present person together
                - builds trust even if honest confrontation not initially appreciated
                - you care enough to confront
            * may seem like a deposit, but a withdrawal. shows you can't be trusted
    * to be trusted > being loved
    * be patient with everyone - people will test your patience, so don't overreact
    * avoid deceptive communication, guile, lack dignity
    * apologize **sincerely** when we make a withdrawal (becomes a deposit):
        - I was wrong
        - That was unkind of me
        - I showed you no respect
        - I embarrassed you in front of everyone, it was uncalled for.
    * repeated apologies are **insincere** = withdrawal
    * mistakes of mind or heart (bad intentions/motives/cover ups/justifications)
        - people will forgive mistakes in lapse of judgement (mind) not the heart
6. Laws of Love and Life
    * unconditional love deposits -> let's others be themselves
        - not permissive/soft/pushover (withdrawal)
        - counsel, plead, set limits/boundaries
    * if attach strings then others become reactive/defensive
        - rebellion from heart not mind
        - make constant deposits of unconditional love
